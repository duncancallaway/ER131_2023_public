    "In this homework, we will investigate air quality data retreived from the EPA, focusing on using Pandas to analyze particulate matter (PM2.5) levels. This homework is graded based on the total number of correct answers. Each question receives 1 or 2 points. 1 point questions receive full credit if answered correctly.  Otherwise they receive 0 points. 2 point questions receive full credit if answered correctly.  If students make progress on the question but don’t answer correctly they receive 1 point.  Otherwise they receive 0 points.\n",
